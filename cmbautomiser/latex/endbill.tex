\ 1.  The measurements on which are based the entries in columns 1 to 6 of Account I, were made by \emph{\cmbissuedto} on \emph{\cmbabstractdate}  and are recorded at pages \emph{..........} to \emph{..........} \ of Measurement Book No. \emph{\cmbbookno} \\

* 2.  Certified that in addition to and quite apart from the quantities of work actually executed as shown in column 4 of account 1, some work has actually been done in connection with several items and the value such work (after deduction therefrom the proportionate amount of secured advances if any, ultimately recoverable on account of the quantities of materials used therein) is in no case less than the advance payments as per item 2 of the memorandum of payments made or proposed to be made for the convenience of the contractor in anticipation of and subject to the results of, detailed measurements which will be made as soon as possible.
